<h1>How to play</h1>
<p>Move game pieces into matches of 3 or more in a straight line horizontally or vertically. 
Doing this on top of "target" cells will break them. 
<p>The aim of JAG is to break all of the "targets" on each level, and to do this before the time runs out. 
Keep doing this until you have beaten the last level and won the game.</p>

<h1>Scoring</h1>
<p>You get score points for removing game pieces. 
Basically, you get 1 point for the ordinary cell and 3 points for the "target" cell. 
The actual points you get are multiplyed by bonus value, so it can be much higher.</p>

<h1>Bonus system</h1>
<p>Bonus is the multiplier which is applyed to every score point you get during the game. 
The bonus raises when you remove "target" cells quickly enough to keep bonus timer run. 
By default bonus timer set to 5 seconds, during the game you can upgrade this value.
<p>To permanently upgrade multiplier value, use the Score-Magnification Bonus.
<p>To permanently upgrade timer value, use the Score-Time Bonus.

<h1>Items</h1>
<p>Every level may contain up to 6 game items. The icon of an item depends on current graphic theme selected. 
<p>In arcade mode there is a reward, which is given for 500 or more pieces of collected items - you can eliminate all the items of the collected type
from the field. You can choose the power of the elimination depending of how many items you collected.

<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>Tools are the special rewards that you take for scoring and collecting game items. There are 10 tools available in the game (2 in the puzzle mode):<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Hammer</span> - destroys an item in the game field<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Nippers</span> - removes a block<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Star</span> - removes item, block and one target<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Clock</span> - adds +60 seconds to the level timer<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Super star</span> - removes everything from a cell<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Bomb</span> - explodes a region of 9 cells<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Mixer</span> - randomly mixes items in the field<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Row Blaster</span> - removes items, blocks and targets in a row<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Bolt</span> - randomly removes items from the field<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Twin Blaster</span> - removes all items of the selected type<br>

<h1>Permanent Bonus</h1>
<p>Unlike tools, permanent bonus, once received, is active for all the further levels. Getting permanent bonus of the same type several times increases its power.
<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Score-Magnification Bonus</span> - permanent +1 to multiplier value<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Score-Time Bonus</span> - permanent extra 1 seconds to bonus timer<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Score Bonus</span> - permanent extra 1 point for the target cell<br>
&#8226; <span style="color:#aaffff">Clock Bonus</span> - permanent extra 30 seconds to level timer<br>

<h1>Arcade vs Puzzle</h1>
<p>There are two play modes in the game - arcade and puzzle. 
The difference is - in arcade mode you can get bonuses for collected items and use all the tools, 
and in the puzzle mode you have only two tools. Also in the puzzle mode level doesn't fail when the time is over,
you may continue, but won't get any bonus points if the time is zero.</p>
